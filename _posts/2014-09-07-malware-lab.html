I had to post this... it's taken me hours to get this damn thing working right. I had my webserver working internally on my network (Apache2 on a Debian VM hosted by Win8) but couldn't get <a href="http://www.inetsim.org/" target="_blank">Inetsim </a>to work.<br /><br />Anyway, here's my settings now, with no special router configuration since it's all internal:<br /><br />- I created a new Group in VirtualBox consisting of my WinXP and Debian VMs.<br />- Each one has network adapter 1 as Bridged over ethernet and adapter 2 as "NAT Network". Note that this isn't just the "NAT" option; it's the NAT Services thing that's new to VirtualBox and currently "experimental" according to the documentation:&nbsp;https://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch06.html.<br />- I edited the Inetsim conf file (/etc/inetsim/inetsim.conf) for the IP binding and set it to the 192.168.200.* address assigned by VirtualBox.<br /><br />Voila!<br /><br />No other configuration would work for some reason even though I could get Apache to serve throughout the network in a few configurations.
