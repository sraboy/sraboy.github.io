What if God lived near the singularity when he was creating existence with the Big Bang? Time passed so slow for him because of the immense gravity but it passed through billions of years on Earth. He could have been blinking things into existence, Bewitched-style, on Earth and thinking he's just plodding along creating existence. All the while, time is passing immensely fast on Earth and passing faster, relatively, the further we get from giant gravity well. I'd guess that even after the explosion a good amount of matter on the inner-end of it all quickly coalesced into a black hole, continuing to support God's slow passage of time.
