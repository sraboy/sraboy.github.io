As I've [said](/about) I love open source. Unless otherwise noted, all content on this site is licensed under [CC BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). Please do check individual posts, repos and files for information on licensing. For example, I do not believe Creative Commons is appropriate for code so that is generally under some version of the GPL or MIT license, or some other license if derived from another's code.

While not required, I'd love to hear if anything here has benefited you. Feel free to just create an issue in the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/sraboy/sraboy.github.io) or email me at steven<[dot]>lavoiejr<[at]>gmail><[dot]>com. I also request that you contact me if I'm misusing a copyrighted work or have mislabeled something's license.
