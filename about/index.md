I love technology.

I'm an engineer at heart (but I only play one on TV). I like to take things apart and, ocassionally, I'll even put them back together. The cheapest way to do this is through reverse engineering and coding. My hobby projects will sometimes go on neglected or indefinitely unfinished because, for me, the journey is in the understanding; once I've "got it" I move on to the next project.

I embrace the phrase "those who can, do; those who can't, teach" as my personal learning philosophy. When I do want to genuinely understand what I'm doing well enough to function independently, I've found that writing and teaching are the best learning tools I've found, so, I try to write tutorials when I really want to grok a topic or skill.

I also love open source and all the benefits brought by an open web and organizations like GNU, GitHub and Khan Academy. I've been teaching myself how to build, break, code and repair for 20+ years thanks to the generosity of others.

I don't have much to offer but I hope this blog and my git repos can start to pay forward on all that free knowledge. I've run several blogs and websites over the years but most have gone the way of GeoCities and Angelfire. While this particular site may not last forever, at least GitHub makes it easy to migrate elsewhere, when needed.
